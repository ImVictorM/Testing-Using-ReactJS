# Testing-Using-ReactJS :construction:
## Project Context 💡

In this project, I had to write tests for a React application that was already created and configured using Jest and React Testing Library (RTL).
The application contains a complete implementation of a Pokédex. My job was to write tests that ensured their correctness. The tests are in path `src/tests`.

### Acquired Knowledge 📖
In this project, i was able to:

- Use React-Testing-Library selectors (queries) in automated tests;
- Simulate events with React-Testing-Library in automated tests;
- Testing asynchronous logic flows with the React-Testing-Library;
- Write tests that cause the structure of application components to be refactored without having to change them;
- Inputs Test.
